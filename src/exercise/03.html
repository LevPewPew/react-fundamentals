  <script type="text/babel">
    // 🐨 on the script tag above, change `type="module"`
    // to `type="text/babel"` so babel will compile this code for the browser to run.

    // 🐨 re-implement this using JSX!
    const className = 'container'
    const id = 'testing spread'
    const children = 'Hello World'
    const props = { className, id, children }
    const element = <div children={children}></div> // NOTE jsx and props know that a prop named children should be put nested
    // into the element. don't explicitly need to put the {children} in
    // const element = <div props>{content}</div> // NOTE: this doesn't work because it compiles to render with the
    // props argument being "props = true", just like when we use a prop with no value as a "flag"

    // 💰 there are a few subtle differences between JSX and HTML. One such
    // difference is how you apply a class to an element in JSX is by using
    // `className` rather than `class`!
    // 📜 You can learn the differences between JSX and HTML syntax from the React docs here:
    // https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#differences-in-attributes

    ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'))
